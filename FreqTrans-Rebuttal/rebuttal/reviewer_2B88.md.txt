Response to Reviewer 2B88

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the strong endorsement of our work and the insightful suggestions.

1. Figure Quality

We replaced Fig. 1 with a vector-format (PDF) version to ensure high resolution and improved readability in both digital and printed formats.

2. Symbol Definitions

We added explicit definitions for all symbols, including $\alpha^{attn}$ and $\gamma_s$, in the method description and provided a notation clarification to ensure mathematical transparency.

3. Baseline Expansion

In response to the suggestion, we expanded the experimental comparison to include more recent and medical-oriented Transformer-based models, strengthening the relevance and fairness of the evaluation.

We appreciate the reviewer’s recognition of the novelty, clinical relevance, and experimental rigor of our approach. The suggested improvements have been fully incorporated to further enhance clarity and completeness.
