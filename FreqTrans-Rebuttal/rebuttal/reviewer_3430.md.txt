Response to Reviewer 3430

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the detailed and constructive comments, which helped us substantially improve the clarity, rigor, and positioning of our work.

1. Writing and Method Issues

Text duplication.  

The duplicated sentence in Section 2.4 has been removed to avoid redundancy.

Unclear hyperparameters.

We have explicitly specified the radius of the circular low-frequency mask ($r_{low}=0.7$, $r_{high}=0.3$) in the Fourier preprocessing module.  
In addition, we clarified that $\alpha^{attn}$ is obtained by passing per-channel frequency statistics through an MLP followed by a sigmoid activation, and this mapping is now explicitly described in both text and equations.

Figure-text mismatch. 
We clarified that the frequency masks are *hard binary masks* and updated both the main text and the caption of Fig. 1 accordingly.

2. Experimental Reporting

Undefined baseline (GSM).

We added a formal definition and citation for GSM in the baseline description and reference list.

AUC discussion.  

To address concerns about AUC differences, we introduced a fixed-recall evaluation protocol (Recall = 0.90) and reported Precision and False Positive Rate (FPR) under this clinically relevant operating point.  
The results show that FreqTrans achieves higher precision and lower FPR than competing methods under the same recall constraint (see `experiments/fixed_recall/`).

3. Evaluation Strengthening

We added comparisons with recent domain-specific methods, including HoVer-Trans and FABRF-Net, and included qualitative Grad-CAM visualizations to demonstrate that FreqTrans focuses more consistently on lesion boundaries rather than background regions (see `visualizations/gradcam/`).

4. Literature and Citations

We updated the literature review to include recent frequency-aware and hybrid architectures, unified citation formatting, and corrected the missing reference.

We believe these revisions comprehensively address the reviewer’s concerns and significantly strengthen the manuscript.
