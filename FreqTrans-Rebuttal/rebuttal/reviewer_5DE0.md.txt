Response to Reviewer 5DE0

We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful critique and valuable suggestions.

1. Figure and Formatting Issues

Figure annotation.

We updated Fig. 1 to explicitly annotate $F^{fused}$ and clarified the data flow in the architecture diagram. The figure has been replaced with a vector-format PDF for improved readability.

Capitalization and spacing. 

Phrases such as “Multi-scale feature extraction and abstraction” are now consistently written in sentence case, and spacing issues after punctuation have been corrected throughout the manuscript.

Missing references.

We added appropriate citations for ResNet50, EfficientNet-B3, and GSM.

2. Clinical Relevance and Qualitative Results

To strengthen clinical interpretability, we added Grad-CAM visualizations comparing FreqTrans with recent methods on the same ultrasound images. These examples demonstrate improved localization around lesion boundaries rather than diffuse activations (see `visualizations/gradcam/`).

3. Updated Baselines

We incorporated recent and relevant methods, including FABRF-Net and HoVer-Trans, into the experimental comparison to better reflect the current state of the art.
We believe these revisions address all raised concerns and improve both clarity and clinical relevance.
