Response to Reviewer 49A5

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the detailed feedback regarding experimental validation and positioning.

1. Baseline Selection

We expanded the experimental comparison to include recent breast-ultrasound-specific and frequency-aware methods, including HoVer-Trans and FABRF-Net. This provides a stronger and more domain-relevant evaluation baseline.

2. Novelty Clarification

While frequency-domain analysis itself is not new, we clarified that our contribution lies in the *adaptive integration* of explicit frequency decomposition, frequency-domain attention, and transformer-based multi-scale modeling within a unified framework.  
We revised the introduction to more clearly state the gap addressed by FreqTrans and how it differs from prior frequency-based methods.

3. Strengthened Validation

In addition to standard metrics, we introduced fixed-recall evaluation (Precision and FPR at Recall = 0.90) to better reflect clinical priorities. We also included qualitative Grad-CAM results to demonstrate improved lesion-focused attention.

We believe these additions substantially strengthen both the experimental rigor and the positioning of the work.
