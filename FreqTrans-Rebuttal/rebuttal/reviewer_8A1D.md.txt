Response to Reviewer 8A1D

We sincerely thank the reviewer for the highly positive and encouraging assessment of our work.

We are pleased that the reviewer finds the proposed frequency-domain Transformer architecture conceptually sound, well motivated, and empirically convincing across datasets. In response to the minor concerns raised, we have made the following refinements:

1. References and literature coverage.

   We carefully reviewed the reference list, removed citations with limited relevance, and added several recent works on frequency-aware and hybrid medical image models to better position our contribution.

2. Architecture justification and ablation clarity.

   We slightly expanded the discussion of architectural design choices and streamlined the ablation analysis to avoid redundancy, while preserving the core empirical evidence supporting each module.

3. Writing and structure.
 
   Minor clarity and formatting issues were corrected throughout the manuscript to further improve readability and presentation quality.

We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive feedback and believe these refinements further strengthen the manuscript without altering its core contributions or conclusions.
