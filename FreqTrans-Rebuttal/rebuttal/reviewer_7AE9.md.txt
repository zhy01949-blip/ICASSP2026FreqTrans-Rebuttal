Response to Reviewer 7AE9

We appreciate the reviewer’s critical perspective and the opportunity to further clarify the contribution and positioning of our work.

1. Relation to Graph Neural Networks

We agree that graph-based spectral methods (e.g., GCNs and GATs) are related in spirit. We have clarified in the manuscript that FreqTrans differs in that it performs *explicit frequency-band decomposition in the signal domain*, rather than implicitly learning spectral responses through graph filters.  
This distinction enables more interpretable and controllable frequency fusion, which is particularly beneficial for noisy ultrasound data.

2. Statistical Robustness

We now report mean ± standard deviation over five independent runs for all main experiments and explicitly state the number of runs and random seeds. Detailed tables and raw results are provided in `experiments/std_results/`.

3. Interpretation of Frequency Contributions

We expanded the discussion to clarify the roles of low- and high-frequency components: low frequencies capture global tissue context, while high frequencies emphasize lesion boundaries and fine structures. Grad-CAM visualizations further support this interpretation by showing stronger boundary-focused activations in FreqTrans.

These clarifications aim to better situate our contribution relative to existing spectral and graph-based approaches.
