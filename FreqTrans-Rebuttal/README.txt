FreqTrans: Rebuttal and Supplementary Materials

This repository provides supplementary materials referenced in the rebuttal for the paper:

FreqTrans: Adaptive Frequency Feature Fusion for Robust Breast Ultrasound Image Analysis
submitted to ICASSP 2024.

The purpose of this repository is to support the rebuttal by providing additional experimental results and qualitative analyses that could not be included in the main paper due to strict page limitations.

Section 1. Revised Manuscript

The repository includes the revised version of the manuscript addressing reviewer comments, as well as the original submission for reference.

Section 2. Response to Reviewers

A detailed point-by-point response to all reviewer comments is provided, explaining how each concern was addressed in the revised manuscript and where the corresponding changes were made.

Section 3. Additional Experimental Results

Supplementary experimental results are provided to demonstrate robustness, including statistics over multiple runs with different random seeds.

Section 4. Model Interpretability and Visualization

Additional qualitative results are provided to improve interpretability, including Grad-CAM visualizations comparing baseline models and the proposed FreqTrans on breast ultrasound images.

Section 5. Note on Supplementary Materials

Due to the strict page limitations of ICASSP, some experimental details and visualizations are provided in this repository. All supplementary materials are consistent with the results reported in the revised manuscript.
